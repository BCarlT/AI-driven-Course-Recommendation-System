Project Title
AI-driven Course Recommendation System

Project Description

Our AI-driven course recommendation system entails the revolution of the course-selecting process by providing students with personalized and tailored recommendations. This project aims to maximize their academic experience and enable them to make well-informed decisions about professions in the future. The data were manually collected from NCCU’s course query website as we focus on the system to be useful for NCCU students.

Getting Started

We first collected our data from NCCU’s course query website, the courses used are from the last 2 semesters which are Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 that were open for undergraduate students. Based on the course's overview, we chose 30 jobs that could be prospects for the students. As there is no AI or data scraping method that could help us with labeling each course to fit the chosen jobs, we manually label each course to the related chosen jobs. Each course could have more than one job. After the labeling, the AI built was a DNN model. The DNN model is the most suitable model for this AI project as of now. RNN is designed to process sequential data, where the output at each step is dependent on the previous steps' outputs while CNN is designed to process grid-like data, such as images or 2D signals. Since we do not use any sequential data or images, hence we chose to work with the DNN model.

File Structure

Dataset:
The AI-driven course system gives out recommendations on courses based on career preferences. We had chosen 30 possible careers based on the courses offered at National Chengchi University for the past 2 semesters (Fall and Spring semesters). The data was collected from the course website of NCCU, and from there we manually labeled the job into each course. It is done manually as currently AI still could not label each course with a possible future job with a high accuracy rate. We also label it based on the syllabus that each course had provided. Even though it is time-consuming, for now, it’s the best method to have the courses labeled accurately.

2023 S_S COURSE.xslx (Spring 2023 Courses)
It contains a total of 1542 data which we labeled 978 courses with 30 job labels. As a result, a job can be labeled with more than one job label. 
2022 F_S COURSE.xslx (Fall 2022 Courses)
It contains a total of 1448 data which we labeled 1103 courses with 30 job labels. As a result, a job can be labeled with more than one job label. 

Code:
In this AI project, the most suitable model is the DNN (Deep Neural Network) model. This choice is based on the nature of the data and the requirements of the project. RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) models are designed for processing sequential data, where the output at each step depends on the previous steps' outputs. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) models, on the other hand, are suitable for processing grid-like data, such as images or 2D signals. Since the project does not involve sequential data or images, the DNN model is a more appropriate choice.

The DNN model is well-suited for this project as it can handle the task of mapping courses to job labels effectively. It can learn complex patterns and relationships between the course attributes and job requirements. By utilizing the DNN model, the AI system can make accurate predictions and provide relevant course recommendations based on the job label input.

To ensure a manageable and user-friendly experience, the system employs the strategy of displaying a limited number of course recommendations. Given that each job may have numerous related courses, presenting all of them at once would make it difficult for users to navigate through the recommendations effectively. Therefore, the system randomizes the selection and outputs 15 courses at a time when a job is entered. This approach introduces variety in the recommendations while still maintaining a manageable number of options for the users to consider.

Overall, the DNN model proves to be the most suitable choice for this project, considering the nature of the data and the need for accurate course recommendations. The system's decision to display 15 randomized courses per job entry ensures a balanced and user-friendly presentation of the recommendations.

Analysis

The problem that we focused on solving is the confusion of students on what courses they should take and what courses that will help them to achieve their careers.

Based on the problem, the benefits of the system are:
Improved Overall Learning Experience and Engagement: Students will have a better overall learning experience and be more engaged thanks to the system's ability to customize course suggestions based on their interests, academic objectives, and previous performance.
Efficient Course Planning: The system may provide students with assistance in the creation of ideal course schedules by taking into consideration requirements, availability, and the student's particular preferences, therefore expediting the process of course planning.
Increased Rates of Retention and Graduation: The system has the potential to assist enhance retention rates and promote timely completion of degree programs by recommending classes that correspond with the academic skills and interests of individual students.

Results

In this particular project, the focus is on the accuracy of the AI system in labeling each course to the corresponding job accurately, rather than on how accurately the system displays the recommended courses to the students. This means that the primary concern is whether the AI can correctly match courses to specific job requirements or career paths.

The accuracy rate mentioned here refers to the correctness of the course labels assigned by the AI to each job. For example, if the AI suggests a programming course for a software developer job, the accuracy rate is determined by how often the AI correctly identifies such matches. This metric evaluates the ability of the AI system to understand the skills and knowledge required for various jobs and map them to relevant courses. This aspect, however, is not considered relevant in this particular project.

On the other hand, the accuracy rate of the course recommendation display refers to how well the AI system presents the recommended courses to the students. 

By disregarding the accuracy rate of the course recommendation display, the project team acknowledges that the system's ability to present the course recommendations accurately does not impact the accuracy of the job-to-course mapping. It implies that even if the AI system's course recommendations are not displayed perfectly or attractively to the students, it does not affect the accuracy of the course labels assigned to the jobs.

This project's main goal is to ensure that the AI system accurately identifies and labels courses to the corresponding jobs, as this directly impacts the effectiveness of the system in assisting students in choosing relevant courses for their desired careers. The emphasis is on the alignment between the courses and the job requirements rather than the presentation of the recommended courses to the students.

While the accuracy rate of the course recommendation display is not considered relevant in this project, it's still important to understand the output of the system, which is the 15 randomized courses recommended to the students. Although the accuracy of the course recommendations may not directly impact the job-to-course mapping accuracy, it can still significantly influence the user experience and effectiveness of the system.

The 15 randomized courses recommended to the students are likely generated by the AI system based on the analysis of job requirements, career paths, and the relevance of various courses. These recommendations aim to provide students with a diverse set of options that align with their desired career goals. Randomization helps to introduce variety and prevents the system from suggesting the same set of courses repeatedly.
